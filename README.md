# DSA-Tutorial: Data Structures & Algorithms in Python

Welcome to the **DSA-Tutorial** repository! This project is a comprehensive collection of tutorials and implementations for various fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using **Python**.

## üåü Features

* **Clear Explanations:** Each data structure and algorithm will come with a dedicated markdown file (`.md`) explaining its concept, operations, and use cases.
* **Python Implementations:** Practical, well-commented Python code (`.py`) demonstrating the implementation of each DSA topic along with leetcode questions.
* **Modular Structure:** Organized into logical folders for easy navigation (e.g., `linked_list/`, `stack/`, `queue/`).
* **Beginner-Friendly:** Designed to be accessible to those new to DSA.
* **Contribution Welcome:** Open to contributions from the community to expand and improve the content.

## üìñ Currently Covered / Planned Topics

This section will be updated as new topics are added.

### Data Structures:
* [ ] **Linked List** (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
* [ ] **Stack**
* [ ] **Queue** (Linear, Circular, Deque)
* [ ] **Hash Table**
* [ ] **Tree** (Binary Tree, BST, AVL, Red-Black)
* [ ] **Heap** (Min-Heap, Max-Heap)
* [ ] **Graph** (Adjacency List/Matrix)

### Algorithms:
* [ ] **Sorting Algorithms** (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, Heap)
* [ ] **Searching Algorithms** (Linear, Binary)
* [ ] **Graph Algorithms** (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, Floyd-Warshall, Kruskal's, Prim's)
* [ ] **Dynamic Programming**
* [ ] **Greedy Algorithms**

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy of this repository up and running on your machine, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.x:** Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* **Git:** For cloning the repository.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Aneerudh17/DSA-Tutorial.git](https://github.com/Aneerudh17/DSA-Tutorial.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd DSA-Tutorial
    ```
3.  **Explore the contents:**
    You can now navigate into any of the topic folders (e.g., `cd linked_list`) and run the Python files or read the markdown explanations.

## üí° How to Use This Repository

Each data structure or algorithm will typically reside in its own dedicated folder. Inside each folder, you'll find:

* A **Python file (`.py`)** containing the implementation and often example usage.
* A **Markdown file (`.md`)** providing a detailed explanation of the concept, its time/space complexity, and practical applications.

**Example:**

To learn about Linked Lists, navigate to the `linked_list/` folder and read `linked_list_basics.md` first, then examine `singly_linked_list.py` (or other linked list variations) to see the code in action.

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are what make the open-source community an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

If you have suggestions for new topics, improvements to existing code, or better explanations, please feel free to contribute!

1.  **Fork the Project.**
2.  **Create your Feature Branch:** `git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`
3.  **Commit your Changes:** `git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`
4.  **Push to the Branch:** `git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`
5.  **Open a Pull Request.**

Please ensure your code adheres to Python best practices, is well-commented, and includes necessary explanations in the markdown files.
